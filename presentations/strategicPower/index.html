```java
class Graph {
  void addEdge(Node from, Node to)

---
# Looks Simple, but&hellip;

- Have to instantiate a `Graph` and `Node`s
- Can only be used with these data types
- `Node` can't store anything but a string
- Limited interface for defining graph's connections
---
# How can we make it better?

- Abstract `Node` type
    - User can define `Node` to hold whatever
- Abstract `Graph` type
    - User chooses how to define connections

abstract class Node {

# Typical Approach

- Most of us have been taught OOP-y design
- Feels natural to have a class for each "thing"

# Haoyi's Ranking of Interfaces
1. Static method with **standard** types
2. Static method with **custom** types
3. Class which must be **instantiated** to be called
4. Abstract class which must be **subclassed**
???
Think in terms of usabilty for the person calling this code.
Hopefully, you are probably the first user of your code when you write tests.
More likely to write tests

Now that Java has added closures nearly every language has closures

Difference between closure and lambda
---
# Closure vs Class

--
- Both wrap (potentially mutable) state
- Both encapsulate data
- Both have method(s) which can be invoked

--
- Closure "constructors" are plausible
- Closure only has one method
- You can fake more with stringy dispatch

--
  - Please don't

---
# Passing Classes to Functions
- Generally if a function needs a thing which can do stuff, we'll pass that object to it
- Often gives the function too much power
    - Can access unrelated data
    - Can access unneeded methods
    - Tight coupling produces brittleness
    - Can potentially mutate the object
---
# Pass Closures, not Classes
- What if instead we pass more restrictive, less powerful thing?
- Provides a nice abstraction layer without explicitly defining interface
- Receiver can only take one action with closure
- Shared interface without inheritance
---
# Architectural Hotspot Patterns
- Unstable interface
- Implicit cross-module dependency
- Unhealthy interface inheritance hierarchy
- Cross-module cycle
- Cross-package cycle

The Closure Koan]
???
The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton. Hoping to prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said "Master, I have heard that objects are a very good thing - is this true?"
--
.medium[
Objects are good]
???
Qc Na looked pityingly at his student and replied, "Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man's closures."
--
.medium[
Poor man's closures]
???
Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell, intent on studying closures. He carefully read the entire "Lambda: The Ultimate..." series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system. He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of his progress.
--
.medium[
Intent on Studying]
???
On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by saying "Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand that objects are truly a poor man's closures."
--
.medium[
Closures are truly good]
???
Qc Na responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying "When will you learn? Closures are a poor man's object."

At that moment, Anton became enlightened.

# The Better Option: Simpler Error Handling
- `Option`, `Optional`, or `Maybe` in most langauges
    - If not in standard then a third party library
--
- Allows you to indicate either a value **or** failure
- No confusion which is which
  - _Is that_ `-1` _a value or a failure code?_
--

- Short circuit evaluation bails out on error
- Pairs exquisitely with lambdas
---
class: middle
.huge[
`Option` is exactly either `Some(value)` or `None`
]
---
```scala
for (
  x <- Some(5)
  y <- Some(7)
) yield x * y
// Results in Some(35)
```
---
```scala
for (
  x <- Some(5)
  y <- None
) yield x * y
// Results in None
```
---
```java
Baz baz = null;
while (true) {
  // 20 lines calculating foo&hellip;
  if (!foo.isValid()) break;
  // 30 lines calculting bar&hellip;
  if (!var.isValid()) break;
  // Another 30 lines calculating wah&hellip;
  if (!wah.isValid()) break;
  baz = new Baz(foo, bar, wah);
  break;
}
return baz;
```
---
# How can we make it better?

- Separate functions to make `Foo`, `Bar`, and `Wah`
--

- Only create valid objects
- Use `Option` to indicate possibility of invalid
---
```scala
def makeFoo(): Option[Foo]
def makeBar(): Option[Bar]
def makeWah(): Option[Wah]

for (
  foo <- makeFoo()
  bar <- makeBar()
  wah <- makeWah()
) yield new Baz(foo, bar, wah)
```
---
```java
Optional<Foo> makeFoo()
Optional<Bar> makeBar()
Optional<Wah> makeWah()

return
  makeFoo().flatMap(foo ->
    makeBar().flatMap(bar ->
      makeWah().map(wah ->
      new Baz(foo, bar, ..., more);
  )));
```
---
# The Better Option: Simpler Error Handling
- Avoids common pitfalls:
  - Not supposed to use `throw` for flow control
  - `null` is the _Billion Dollar Mistake_ [according to inventor](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare)
  - Don't have to remember to check error code
---
# Limited `Option`
- We can't say what went wrong
- There are other types, like `Either`, to express more detailed failure
---
background-image: url("assets/bowtie.gif")
---
# Summary

- Deliberate constraints simplify code use and maintenance
--

- Better predictability makes refactoring and testing easier
--

- More powerful solution is not necessarily better
--

    - Mo' power, mo' problems!
---
# How?
- Immutability
- Constrained Interfaces
- Lambdas to Restrict Coupling
- `Option` to Express Possible Failure
