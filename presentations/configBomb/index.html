# What's Input to Our Apps?

- User Input
- State from Data Store

- Configuration

# Examples of config driven outages

- Google App Engine down for [2.5 hours in Feb 2010](http://www.availabilitydigest.com/public_articles/0504/google_power_out.pdf)
- AWS EC2 and RDS down for [days in Apr 2011](https://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/)
- Microsoft Azure down for [2.5 hours in Jul 2012](http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/content-tracks/servers-storage/microsoft-misconfigured-network-device-led-to-azure-outage/68312.article)

# 2010 Google App Engine Outage

1. Power went down
2. Backup power didn't reach some boxes
3. Ops followed procedure to reconfigure to fail over
--

4. New configuration was busted
5. Outage persisted

.footnote[From [availabilitydigest](http://www.availabilitydigest.com/public_articles/0504/google_power_out.pdf)]

# Anecdote from Rubicon Project

1. Homegrown system for managing data retention and mirroring
2. JIRA created to change retention time
3. PR sent, reviewed, and merged
--

4. Syntax error in config makes app fail
5. Reporting pipeline stops because no mirroring
6. Engineers get called on a weekend

Since it is hard to completely avoid configuration errors (after all, everyone makes mistakes; as do system administrators), a more practical approach is to detect such errors as early as possible in order to minimize their failure damage

---

.medium[Why isn't it enough to start the app and see if it works after a config change?]

---

1. Squid reconfigured to change log rotation
2. Squid didn't validate that config on startup
3. Error was exposed much later after days of execution
--

4. Next attempt to rotate results in Squid in a busy loop, hogging CPU for 7 hours
5. Figuring our the root cause takes days

Although there have been fewer latent configuration errors than non-latent ones, latent configuration errors contribute to 75% of the high-severity issues and take much longer to diagnose, indicating their high impact and damage.]

# What would we do in an ideal world?

- Validate configuration on startup
- Validate more than "value is present" but also "value is usable"
- Provide a utility to validate config outside of app

Now that Java has added closures nearly every language has closures

Difference between closure and lambda
---
# Closure vs Class

--
- Both wrap (potentially mutable) state
- Both encapsulate data
- Both have method(s) which can be invoked

--
- Closure "constructors" are plausible
- Closure only has one method
- You can fake more with stringy dispatch

--
  - Please don't

---
# Passing Classes to Functions
- Generally if a function needs a thing which can do stuff, we'll pass that object to it
- Often gives the function too much power
    - Can access unrelated data
    - Can access unneeded methods
    - Tight coupling produces brittleness
    - Can potentially mutate the object
---
# Pass Closures, not Classes
- What if instead we pass more restrictive, less powerful thing?
- Provides a nice abstraction layer without explicitly defining interface
- Receiver can only take one action with closure
- Shared interface without inheritance
---
# Architectural Hotspot Patterns
- Unstable interface
- Implicit cross-module dependency
- Unhealthy interface inheritance hierarchy
- Cross-module cycle
- Cross-package cycle

Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell, intent on studying closures.

He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of his progress.

# The Better Option: Simpler Error Handling
- `Option`, `Optional`, or `Maybe` in most langauges
    - If not in standard then a third party library
--
- Allows you to indicate either a value **or** failure
- No confusion which is which
  - _Is that_ `-1` _a value or a failure code?_
--

- Short circuit evaluation bails out on error
- Pairs exquisitely with lambdas
---
class: middle
.huge[
`Option` is exactly either `Some(value)` or `None`
]
---
```scala
for (
  x <- Some(5)
  y <- Some(7)
) yield x * y
// Results in Some(35)
```
---
```scala
for (
  x <- Some(5)
  y <- None
) yield x * y
// Results in None
```
---
```java
Baz baz = null;
while (true) {
  // 20 lines calculating foo&hellip;
  if (!foo.isValid()) break;
  // 30 lines calculting bar&hellip;
  if (!var.isValid()) break;
  // Another 30 lines calculating wah&hellip;
  if (!wah.isValid()) break;
  baz = new Baz(foo, bar, wah);
  break;
}
return baz;
```
---
# How can we make it better?

- Separate functions to make `Foo`, `Bar`, and `Wah`
--

- Only create valid objects
- Use `Option` to indicate possibility of invalid
---
```scala
def makeFoo(): Option[Foo]
def makeBar(): Option[Bar]
def makeWah(): Option[Wah]

for (
  foo <- makeFoo()
  bar <- makeBar()
  wah <- makeWah()
) yield new Baz(foo, bar, wah)
```
---
```java
Optional<Foo> makeFoo() { &hellip;}
Optional<Bar> makeBar() { &hellip; } 
Optional<Wah> makeWah() { &hellip; } 

return
  makeFoo().flatMap(foo ->
    makeBar().flatMap(bar ->
      makeWah().map(wah ->
        new Baz(foo, bar, wah);
  )));
```
---
# The Better Option: Simpler Error Handling
- Avoids common pitfalls:
  - Not supposed to use `throw` for flow control
  - `null` is the _Billion Dollar Mistake_ [according to inventor](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare)
  - Don't have to remember to check error code
---
# Limited `Option`
- We can't say what went wrong
- There are other types, like `Either`, to express more detailed failure
---
background-image: url("assets/bowtie.gif")

# Summary

- Deliberate constraints simplify code use and maintenance
--

- Better predictability makes refactoring and testing easier
--

- More powerful solution is not necessarily better
--

    - Mo' power, mo' problems!
---
# How?
- Immutability
- Constrained Interfaces
- Lambdas to Restrict Coupling
- `Option` to Express Possible Failure
